# sleep-detection
The use case of this program was to detect if a driver is sleeping on the wheel or not. The script uses dlib and opencv libraries.

# Working

The programs calculate the ratio of the vertical and horizontal distance in a persons eye. If this ration is less than a certain number the program determines that the eye is closed.
If the eyse is closed, a startTimer will start ticking the the elapsed time the eye has been close. If this timer goes over 5 sec, the person is determined to be sleeping.

Another parameter to determine the sleep is the head tilt. If the tilt angle is less than 35 degrees the timer will start. If the timer reaches the upper limit (5 sec) the person is considered sleeping.
